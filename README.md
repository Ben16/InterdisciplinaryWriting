# Interdisciplinary Writing
A collection of writing samples for Northeastern's ENGW3315 class. All works have been converted to pdf's for ease of viewing in browser.

# Overview
I've written three pieces over the course of the semester, each with its own prompt and focus. If you'd like an overview of my work in general and my thoughts on the semester as a whole, I recommend taking a look at my [reflection piece](Reflection.pdf).

For a more step-by-step discussion of each unit, see the following sections.

# Unit 1
This unit focused upon "analyzing interdisciplinary discourse." I was tasked with picking out a piece of writing from my discipline, for which I selected the [site for the buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) I worked on during my first co-op. I then analyzed very deeply a short section from this site. You can read my analysis [here](Showcase/Unit1/FinalDraft.pdf).

# Unit 2
This unit required writing a reference document for my discipline. Specifically, I was tasked with filling a gap in my discipline. It was difficult to determine the precise gap, but I eventually settled upon proposing improvements to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). I made a slideshow proposing changes to the site and a cover letter briefly introducing the changes. These can be viewed in [this directory](Showcase/Unit2). This is the unit that my work changed most significantly between my rough and final drafts; as such, I have included my rough draft of cover letter and reference document [here](Supporting&#32;Materials).

# Unit 3
This unit required performing a literature review on a topic in my discipline. I elected to review literature concerning machine learning and medicine. Going in, I knew about the general concept of machine learning, but was eager to learn more, as it is a popular concept in computer science today. I elected to study the medicinal focus of machine learning as a means of providing a more precise focus on my discussion. My full literature review is [here](Showcase/Unit3/FinalDraft.pdf).

# Non-final Works
All materials included in the [Showcase](Showcase) folder are my final drafts. However, I have also included my rough drafts from Unit 2 in the [Supporting Materials](Supporting&#32;Materials) folder. My final draft for this unit changed most significantly, so I have included these to enable the reader to glimpse into my revision process.
