# Interdisciplinary Writing
A collection of writing samples for Northeastern's ENGW3315 class.

# Overview
I've written three pieces over the course of the semester, each with its own prompt and focus. If you'd like an overview of my work in general and my thoughts on the semester as a whole, I recommend taking a look at my [reflection piece](Reflection.docx).

For a more step-by-step discussion of each unit, see the following sections.

# Unit 1
This unit focused upon "analyzing interdisciplinary discourse." I was tasked with picking out a piece of writing from my discipline, for which I selected the [site for the buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) I worked on during my first co-op. I then analyzed very deeply a short section from this site. You can read my analysis in the [Unit1 folder](Unit1).

# Unit 2
This unit required writing a reference document for my discipline. Specifically, I was tasked with filling a gap in my discipline. It was difficult to determine the precise gap, but I eventually settled upon proposing improvements to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). I made a slideshow proposing changes to the site and a cover letter briefly introducing the changes. These can be viewed in the [Unit2 folder](Unit2).

# Unit 3
This unit required performing a literature review on a topic in my discipline. I elected to review literature concerning machine learning and medicine. I knew about the general concept of machine learning and knew nothing of medicine. My full literature review is in the [Unit3 folder](Unit3).
